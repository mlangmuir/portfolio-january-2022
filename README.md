# Portfolio: January 2022

My very first portfolio. This was my final project for the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design certificate. While most of this project uses just HTML and CSS, this was also the first time I introduced JavaScript to a project. The typewriter function was written using an event listener that fires when the user loads the page.
